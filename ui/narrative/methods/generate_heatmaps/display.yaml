description : |
   <p>This method helps in visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNA-seq data using csHeatmap method from CummeRbund Package. It uses the data produced from Cuffdiff RNA-seq differential expression analysis as input and allows to visualize the heatmap of differentially expressed genes. The expression matrix with or without replicates which were used to create heatmaps are also generated as output objects.</p>
