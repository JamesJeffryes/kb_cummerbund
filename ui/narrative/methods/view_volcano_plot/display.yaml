    <p>View interactive volcano plot. This app takes a differential expression statistics output produced by running the app View CummeRbund Plots. It takes two condition as input. It creates an interactive volcano plot.
    The slider in the output plot can be used to select appropriate q_value and fold change cutoff and display number of genes and their functional annotation. </p>
