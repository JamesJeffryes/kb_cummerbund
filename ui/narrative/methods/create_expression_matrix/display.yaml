description : |
    <p>This method allows you to create the expression matrix based on differentially expressed data obtained from cuffdiff method. It takes cuffdiff output as input and provides the average value of the expression values of the replicates. Replicates option allow users to get the expression matrix of all the conditions with replicates.The expression values are provided as log10(FPKM+1).</p>
