name     : Create Differential Expression Matrix and HeatMap using Cuffdiff 
tooltip  : |
    Compare a pair of conditions in RNA-seq expression data to identify differentially expressed genes and view them in an interactive heatmap. This method requires more than one condition and each condition should have at least two replicates.

    ws_cuffdiff_id:
        ui-name : |
            Cuffdiff Object
        short-hint : |
            Differentially expressed data from Cuffdiff
        short-hint : |
            Differentially expressed data from Cuffdiff. This object can be obtained by running the Identify Differential Expression using Cuffdiff app

    sample1:
        ui-name : |
            Treatment Label 1
        short-hint : |
            Sample condition to identify differentially expressed genes
    sample2:
        ui-name : |
            Treatment Label 2
        short-hint : |
            Sample condition to identify differentially expressed genes
    q_value_cutoff:
        ui-name : |
            q_value Cutoff (-Log10 value)
        short-hint : |
            absolute value of -Log10 (q_value_cutoff)
        long_hint : |
            absolute value of -Log10 (q_value_cutoff). The default value of 1.5  corresponds to q_value of 0.1. Ideally  2 or more should be used as cutoff.

    log2_fold_change_cutoff:
        ui-name : |
            Fold Change Cutoff (Log2 value)
        short-hint : |
            Absolute value of Log2(fold change) cutoff
    num_genes:
        ui-name : |
            Number of Genes 
        short-hint : |
            Number of genes selected for heatmap display (Optimal number is 100)
        long-hint : |
            Number of genes selected for heatmap display (Optimal number is 100)
            Genes are first sorted by q-value cutoff and then top genes are selected based on fold change cutoff
          
    ws_expression_matrix_id:
        ui-name : |
            Filtered Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Filtered expression matrix associated with the heatmap. 
            

description : |
   <p> This method helps in the visualization of high-throughput RNA-seq data using CummeRbund Package. Differentially expressed genes are identified 
       and displayed as heatmap. Note that the differentially expressed genes are selected  based on q_value Cutoff (-LOG 10 value) and  Fold Change Cutoff (LOG2 value).
       </p> 
       <p>
       This method expects a Cuffdiff object obtained by running Identify Differential Expression using Cuffdiff  app as part of RNA-Seq analysis. Two other apps  should be run prior to using the app. View CummeRbund plot app should be used to get the QC plots as well as differential statistics output of all genes.
       The differential statistics information should be viewed using View interactive volcano plot app to decide on approproate q_value Cutoff and Fold Change Cutoff and the number of genes to be displayed on heatmap.

       If none of the genes pass the cutoff criteria, this method reports an error "Please select a different cutoff criteria. None of the genes passed fold change and q-value-cutoff. Failed to create expression matrix with differentially expressed genes. No genes to show on heatmap.
       To fix this error, user should go to the volcano plot app and ensure that the cutoff selection is appropriate.
       
       This app expects -LOG10 (q_value_cutoff) and LOG2(Fold change).
