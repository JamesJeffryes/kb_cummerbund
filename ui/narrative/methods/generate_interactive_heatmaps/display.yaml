description : |
   <p>This method helps in the visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNA-seq data using CummeRbund Package (csHeatmap method). It uses the data produced from Cuffdiff RNA-seq differential expression analysis as input and creates a heatmap of differentially expressed genes. The expression matrix with or without replicates which were used to create heatmaps are also generated as output objects.</p>
