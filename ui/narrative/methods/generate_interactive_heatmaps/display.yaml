description : |
   <p>This method helps in the visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNA-seq data using CummeRbund Package (csHeatmap method). It uses the data produced from Cuffdiff RNA-seq differential expression analysis as input and creates a heatmap of differentially expressed genes. Note that, the matrix is filtered based on Alpha Cutoff, Fold Change Cutoff and Number of Genes and sorted by Fold Change Cutoff.</p>
