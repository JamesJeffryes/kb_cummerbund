description : |
   <p>This method helps in exploration, analysis and  visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNA-seq data.</p> 
   <p>It uses the large amount of data produced from Cuffdiff RNA-seq differential expression analysis as input and allows user to easily navigate through it by visualizing different types of CummeRbund plots including squared coefficient of variation (SCV) plots, density plot of genes in the two samples, scatter plot, volcano matrix plots, etc.</p>
    
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
