description : |
   <p>This method helps in exploration, analysis and  visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNASeq data. It uses the data produced from Cuffdiff RNASeq differential expression analysis as input and allows to visualize the estimated overdispersion for each sample as a quality control measure.</p> 
    <p>This method allows user to visualize different type of CummeRbund plots including squared coefficient of variation (SCV) plots, density plot of genes in the two samples, scatter plot and volcano matrix plot.</p>
