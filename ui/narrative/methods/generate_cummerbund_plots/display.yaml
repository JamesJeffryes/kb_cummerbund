description : |
   <p>This method helps in exploration, analysis and  visualization of Cufflinks high-throughput RNA-seq data.</p> 
    <p>It uses the data produced from Cuffdiff RNA-seq differential expression analysis as input and This method allows user to visualize different type of CummeRbund plots including squared coefficient of variation (SCV) plots, density plot of genes in the two samples, scatter plot, volcano matrix plot etc.</p>
